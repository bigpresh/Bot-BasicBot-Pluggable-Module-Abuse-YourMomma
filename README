FAQs
    Isn't this remarkably childish, silly and immature?
        Erm,, yes.

    Shouldn't this be under the `Acme::' namespace?
        Probably, except Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable modules go under the
        `Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module' namespace, so, here it is.

    Were you bored when you wrote this?
        Whatever would make you think that?

    Who is the fat controller?
        Why, it's Ross, of course. *waves*
